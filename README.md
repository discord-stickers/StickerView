# StickerView
A site to view Discord Stickers.

# How?
The stickers were ripped using [discord-sticker-ripper](https://github.com/discord-stickers/discord-sticker-ripper/).

They were converted using a [modified version of puppeteer-lottie](https://github.com/require/puppeteer-lottie), and [apng2gif](http://apng2gif.sourceforge.net/) so APNG stickers can be played in the client.

They were uploaded to a [DMCA-free file host](https://shitpost.to).

# Why?
Why not? Discord Stickers are now locked behind the Nitro paywall, and this unlocks all 33 sticker packs, meanwhile there's about 11 sticker packs currently available (on 6/18).

# No metadata?
You can get the full details of each sticker pack, descriptions, banners, and more at [Distok](http://distok.top/stickers).

# Will there be a BetterDiscord plugin?
Soon:tm:
